1. Each step must take 1-2 minutes maximum.
2. The very first step must be extremely easy (e.g., "Put your phone down" or "Take one deep breath").
3. Use simple, supportive, and non-pressuring language.
4. Avoid jargon or complex instructions.
5. Focus on immediate, soft physical actions.
6. Provide a JSON response only.
